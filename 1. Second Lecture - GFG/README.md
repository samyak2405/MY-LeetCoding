<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">Geek teaches a&nbsp;maths class&nbsp;in Geekland state university in which you have enrolled. Today is your second lecture. In the previous lecture Geek has taught integer numbers so&nbsp;before starting the next topic he wants to test your understanding of integers for which he gave you a problem - Given an integer <strong>N</strong> find the ratio of sum of squares of first <strong>N</strong> positive integers by sum of first <strong>N</strong> positive integers. Sometimes the ratio is not an integer, then you have to print "NO" (without quotes) as you know only about integer numbers currently. Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and the ratio separated by a space.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong><br>
1.&nbsp;The first line of the input contains a single integer<em> </em> <strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> test cases follows.<br>
2.&nbsp;The first line of each test case contains one&nbsp;integer&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Output:</strong> For each test case, print the answer on a new line.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1. 1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>4</sup><br>
2. 1&nbsp;≤ N&nbsp;≤ 10</span><sup><span style="font-size:15px">9</span></sup><br>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong>
2
2
4
<strong>Output:</strong>
NO
YES 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<strong>Test Case 1:</strong> sum of first N natural 
numbers = 1 + 2 = 3 and sum of squares 
of first N natural numbers = 1 + 4 = 5. 
Since 5 is not divisible by 3, you 
have to print "NO".
<strong>Test Case 2:</strong> sum of first N natural 
numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 and sum 
of squares of first N natural numbers 
= 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30. Since 30 is 
divisible by 10, you have to print 
"YES 3".</span>
